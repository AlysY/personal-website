Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the School of Life and Environmental Science at Deakin University under the supervision of Prof [Emily Nicholson](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/450577-emily-nicholson) and Prof [Brett Bryan](https://www.planet-a.earth/prof-brett-bryan).

My PhD thesis examines how to bridge types of data and knowledges from global to local scales for conservation on Indigenous lands. I have worked collaboratively with the [Tiwi Land Council](https://tiwilandcouncil.com/), [Tiwi Resources](https://tiwiresources.com.au/) and Tiwi people to define, describe and map ecosystems on the Tiwi Islands which I wrote about [here](https://conservationscience.org.au/2023/05/10/weaving-knowledges-and-methods-for-ecosystem-science-on-the-tiwi-islands/). I have also been able to work on [a project](https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/projects/arid-zone-monitoring-surveys-for-vertebrates-across-arid-and-semi-arid-zones) with data collected by Indigenous ranger groups as well as academics and NGOs to investigate the trends of animal populations over the desert regions of Australia. 

Prior to my PhD, I undertook a Masters in ecology, focusing on identifying drought refuges for [the threatened Malleefowl](https://www.nespthreatenedspecies.edu.au/projects/recovering-malleefowl-with-adaptive-management-of-feral-predators) in semi-arid regions of Australia. I applied generlised linear mixed models with remotely sensed variables to a citizen science dataset with over 20 years of data to identify gaps in the current protected area network, which you can read about [here](https://doi.org/10.1111/acv.12763).  

I have also worked as a research assistant undertaking modelling. At the National Centre for Coasts and Climate (University of Melbourne), we investigated the potential of native species to provide coastal protection through distribution models of 14 species and a [multi-criteria suitability analysis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2023.102857), which I then developed into [a decision support tool](https://livingshorelines.shinyapps.io/VicMap/). I also built Bayesian spatio-temporal models to investigate anti-microbial resistance patterns across Australia with CSIRO.  

I am passionate about delivering scientific outputs to the wider community through data visualization. I developed a website to present results from the [NESP Arid Zone Monitoring](https://aridzonemonitoring.org/) project, undertook the mapping, tracking, visualisation and report writing regarding [anti-microbial resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N50byFx3ss), and built a website to display [urban threatened species](https://threatenedspeciesincities.org/).
