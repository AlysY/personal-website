Alys Young is a PhD canditate in the Centre for Integrative Ecology, Deakin University. Working collaborative with the [Tiwi Land Council](https://tiwilandcouncil.com/) and [Tiwi Resources](https://tiwiresources.com.au/), Alys is investigating the distribution and dynamics of species and ecosystems on the Tiwi Islands to inform conservation and land management decisions. Alys has a particular interesting in weaving contemporary science with Indigenous knowledge.

Alys also works as a research assistant undertaking modelling projects and designing shiny app. Examples of the shiny apps include communicating research results for the [NESP Arid Zone Monitoring](https://aridzonemonitoring.org/) project, mapping and tracking [antimicrobial resistance](https://anti-microbe-res.shinyapps.io/hotspots/) and showing [urban threatened species](https://threatenedspeciesincities.org/).
